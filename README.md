# <p align="center">Aggie Shell<p>

**Introduction**

In this programming project, I implemented my very own Linux shell that is called “Aggie Shell”. After all, the earliest OS interfaces were indeed the terminal shell or shell-like interfaces! The Linux/Ubuntu shell in my OS lets a user navigate through the file system and performs a wide variety of tasks using a series of simple commands. It also offers capabilities of inter-process communication and file input/out redirection. My shell has the ability to function almost as well as BASH. Each Linux command (e.g., cat, echo, cd, etc.) is to be run as child processes. Most of these commands sit as executables in my system and are recognized by a call to an exec()-family function.

The pdf attached shows an extensive report of the code.

**Tasks**

This shell is built to support to following:
  - [ ] basic commands
  - [ ] commands in a pipeline
  - [ ] file input/output redirection
  - [ ] multi-piped and redirection
  - [ ] background processes
